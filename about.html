        <h1>Main Reasons</h1>

        <p>
            Naruto does something that really almost no other well-known shonen did before it. In its earliest arcs, Naruto introduces almost all of its main characters. These characters are the characters that fans will be going through the series alongside, and due to the nature of the series beginning with childhood and ending with adulthood, growing with as well.

This is something that no other very popular shonen has done to the effect of Naruto. In fact, this act of watching the cast growing actually evokes a bit of a sitcom feel and is one of the main draws of the series. The leaders in the series show the younger generation how to properly lead people to achieve a common goal.

      <h2>Great Teachings

      </h2>
        <p>
            Like many shonen series, Naruto's audience is of course first and foremost young children. This impressionable audience, like many young audiences, needs a story with a bit of substance to help stimulate their young minds. Enter Naruto: A story that begins with a young child much like the readers out there that some can relate to.

This makes this story the perfect vessel to teach life lessons and more to the readers, and Naruto is chock full of those. From never giving up to always being there for your true friends, there are a lot of great lessons in the series. Even the villians give you a new perspectice of ways of looking at life.

        <h3>
            Great Overall Plot
        </h3>
          <p>
            No one will tell you that Naruto has the most complex nor the best plot in all of manga, but that's what makes it so great. While the plot is very basic and makes some missteps that doesn't matter when it's enjoyable as all hell.

This plot has sucked in plenty of manga and anime fans everywhere. The mysteries and questions that arise keep them moving and the potential conclusions are enough to make anyone want to read more and more.
